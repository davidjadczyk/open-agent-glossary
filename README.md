# open-agent-glossary

Tool-agnostic glossary management for coding agents.

Define domain terms once in a `glossary.json` or `glossary.jsonl` file and use them from:

- **Pi** via extension — lazy-loads definitions into the system prompt when terms are mentioned
- **Claude Code** via hooks — injects matching definitions on every prompt
- **Any MCP-capable agent** via stdio MCP server — explicit lookup, add, edit, remove tools
- **CLI scripts** directly

The goal is **fast setup** and **one shared source of truth** across every tool your team uses.

## Background

This project is built on top of the schema and concepts from [pi-glossary](https://github.com/ruliana/pi-glossary) by [@ruliana](https://github.com/ruliana) — an excellent Pi extension for glossary injection.

The goal here is to take the same idea further and make it **tool-agnostic**: one shared glossary file that works seamlessly across Pi, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and any MCP-capable agent. Your team maintains a single `.agents/glossary.jsonl` in the repo, and every agent — regardless of which tool a developer uses — picks it up automatically.

Existing `glossary.json` files from `pi-glossary` are **100% schema-compatible** and can be dropped in without changes.

---

## Why this package exists

Project acronyms and domain language drift fast. Agents either guess, ask again, or use the wrong meaning. `open-agent-glossary` fixes that by loading glossary terms from local files and making them available to agents automatically or on demand, without bloating every turn's prompt.

**Definitions are only injected when the current prompt references a matching glossary handle.**

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g open-agent-glossary
# or use directly with
npx open-agent-glossary --help
```

---

## 60-second setup

### 1) Initialize the project

The fastest way to get started is now:

```bash
open-agent-glossary init
```

This scaffolds:

```text
.open-agent-glossary/
  config.json
  glossary.json
```

- `config.json` contains sensible defaults
- `glossary.json` starts as an empty glossary ready to edit in the UI or via CLI

You can also initialize globally:

```bash
open-agent-glossary init --global
```

And overwrite existing files if needed:

```bash
open-agent-glossary init --force
```

### 2) Add glossary terms

You can now either:

- edit `.open-agent-glossary/glossary.json` directly
- use the local UI: `open-agent-glossary ui`
- or use the CLI:

```bash
open-agent-glossary add "BFF" "Backend For Frontend" --scope project --cwd .
```

You can still place glossaries in any supported path:

- `.agents/glossary.json` / `.agents/glossary.jsonl` ← recommended for shared team glossaries
- `.pi/glossary.json` / `.pi/glossary.jsonl` ← Pi-only
- `.open-agent-glossary/glossary.json` ← package-scoped project glossary created by `init`

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "term": "BFF",
    "definition": "Backend For Frontend — a dedicated backend service tailored to a specific frontend application.",
    "aliases": ["backend for frontend", "bff-pattern"]
  },
  {
    "term": "DRY",
    "definition": "Don't Repeat Yourself — reduce repetition of information across a codebase.",
    "aliases": ["dont repeat yourself"]
  }
]
```

Or JSONL (preferred for team repos — easier diffs, fewer merge conflicts):

```jsonl
{"term":"BFF","definition":"Backend For Frontend — a dedicated backend service tailored to a specific frontend application.","aliases":["backend for frontend"]}
{"term":"DRY","definition":"Don't Repeat Yourself — reduce repetition of information across a codebase.","aliases":["dont repeat yourself"]}
```

### 3) Pick your integration

#### Pi

```bash
pi install npm:open-agent-glossary
```

#### Claude Code hook

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPrompt": [
      {
        "matcher": ".*",
        "command": "npx open-agent-glossary inject --prompt \"$USER_PROMPT\" --cwd \"$CWD\""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### MCP (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, any MCP client)

Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glossary": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["open-agent-glossary", "mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

That is enough to start.

## Pi — Extension Details

Pi offers the closest to a native glossary experience because it runs as a **Pi Extension** bundled inside this package.

### Install

```bash
pi install npm:open-agent-glossary
```

### How It Works

1. On session start, the extension loads `~/.agents/glossary.json(.l)`, `~/.pi/agent/glossary.json(.l)`, `.agents/glossary.json(.l)`, and `.pi/glossary.json(.l)` from the current project.
2. Project entries override global entries when they share the same `term`.
3. Before each agent turn, the extension scans the user's prompt for matching glossary terms, aliases, or explicit regex patterns.
4. If terms match, **only terms not already loaded in the current session** are injected into the system prompt.
5. Loaded glossary handles stay visible in the footer status for the rest of the session as `Glossary: term, term`.

### What You Get

- Automatic lazy injection — definitions only appear when the prompt references a matching handle
- Term highlighting while typing
- Footer status showing loaded glossary handles
- `glossary_lookup` tool the LLM can call explicitly
- `/glossary` — show glossary load status
- `/glossary reload` — reload glossary files without restarting Pi

### When Glossary Files Change

Pi keeps glossary entries in memory for the session. Run `/glossary reload` after editing, or start a new session.

---

## Claude Code Hooks

On every prompt:
1. Glossary files are loaded from disk.
2. Terms are matched against the prompt.
3. Matching definitions are returned to the agent as context.

Changes to shared project glossaries are picked up automatically on the **next prompt** — no reload needed.

---

## MCP

Use MCP when your agent supports MCP but not prompt hooks, or when you want explicit tools for lookup/edit/list.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `glossary_lookup` | Look up a term |
| `glossary_list` | List all terms |
| `glossary_add` | Add an entry |
| `glossary_edit` | Edit an entry |
| `glossary_remove` | Remove an entry |

The MCP server re-reads glossary files on every tool call — no reload needed.

---

## GitHub Copilot

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "glossary": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["open-agent-glossary", "mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Add `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to make Copilot use it proactively:

```markdown
## Glossary

This project uses a shared glossary for domain-specific terms.
When the user mentions an unfamiliar project term or acronym,
use the `glossary_lookup` tool to get its authoritative definition.
At the start of a conversation, use `glossary_list` to see all available terms.
```

See `hooks/github-copilot.md` for full hook and CLI setup.

---

## Shared Project Glossaries

This is a first-class use case. Put the team glossary at:

```text
.agents/glossary.jsonl
```

Why `.jsonl` for shared files?
- Easier line-based diffs
- Fewer merge conflicts when multiple people add entries
- Easy to append entries
- Works with every integration (not just Pi)

### Reload Behavior by Integration

| Integration | Reload behavior |
|---|---|
| Pi | Loaded at session start; `/glossary reload` after changes |
| Claude hook | Re-read on every prompt |
| MCP | Re-read on every tool call |
| CLI | Re-read on every command |

### Merge Order (later wins on same `term`)

1. `~/.pi/agent/glossary.json(.l)` — global Pi terms
2. `~/.agents/glossary.json(.l)` — global cross-tool terms
3. `.pi/glossary.json(.l)` — project Pi terms
4. `.agents/glossary.json(.l)` — project cross-tool terms ← recommended

---

## Glossary Entry Format

```json
{
  "term": "BFF",
  "definition": "Backend For Frontend ...",
  "aliases": ["backend for frontend"],
  "pattern": "BFF|backend.?for.?frontend",
  "flags": "iu",
  "enabled": true,
  "source": "project-glossary"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `term` | yes | canonical handle |
| `definition` | yes | authoritative definition |
| `aliases` | no | extra plain-text triggers |
| `pattern` | no | explicit regex — overrides default matcher |
| `flags` | no | regex flags, default `iu` |
| `enabled` | no | set `false` to disable |
| `source` | no | provenance label |

---

## Local UI

The local UI is the easiest way to understand what the glossary is doing and to
manage entries without editing JSON by hand.

It is served by a lightweight [hono](https://hono.dev) control server embedded
in the core package, binds to **`127.0.0.1` only**, and never transmits data
anywhere.

### Start it

```bash
# Start the local UI
open-agent-glossary ui

# Choose a custom port
open-agent-glossary ui --port 4319

# Do not auto-open the browser
open-agent-glossary ui --no-open

# Run the UI alongside the MCP server for an active agent session
open-agent-glossary mcp-serve --ui --open
```

By default it runs at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7337
```

### What the UI shows

![open-agent-glossary UI overview](docs/ui-overview.png)

The redesigned UI includes four screens:

- **Overview**
  - glossary file discovery
  - merge order / precedence visualization
  - current session state
  - top-level lookup and injection metrics

- **Glossary**
  - searchable entries browser
  - list / split / cards layouts
  - inline add / edit / delete
  - alias and tag chip editors
  - live regex / pattern tester against sample text
  - provenance for where a term came from

- **Usage**
  - all-time vs current-session analytics
  - activity timeline
  - top terms by lookups or injections
  - detection of “looked up often, rarely injected” terms

- **Config**
  - config resolution stack
  - effective values with origin tracking
  - inline edits written back to the active config file

### How it works

- `open-agent-glossary ui` starts the control server and serves the UI assets
- the browser talks to the local JSON API under `/api`
- the UI uses the same glossary/config/session/usage logic as the CLI and MCP server
- everything is local-only and file-backed

### Config + glossary bootstrap

If this is a fresh project, initialize everything first:

```bash
open-agent-glossary init
open-agent-glossary ui
```

That gives you a default config plus an empty glossary file that you can start
editing immediately in the UI.

### Autostart

Enable autostart so the UI boots with every agent session:

```json
{
  "ui": { "autostart": true, "port": 7337, "open": true }
}
```

### Packaging note

The UI is shipped as a prebuilt package (`open-agent-glossary-ui`) via
`optionalDependencies` — nothing is compiled on the user's machine. If it is
not installed, the control server still serves the JSON API under `/api` and
shows an install hint at `/`.

### Global storage

Per-user state lives under `~/.open-agent-glossary/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `usages.json` | Usage tracking (per-term / per-session / global totals) |
| `projects.json` | Registry of project roots seen by the tool (powers discovery) |
| `config.json` | Optional package-scoped global config |
| `glossary.json` | Optional package-scoped global glossary |

The registry grows organically — every time the control server starts in a repo,
that root is recorded so the “glossaries on this computer” view stays current.
No full-disk scanning is ever performed.

## Config

Config uses **first-found wins**.

### Project-level (highest priority)

- `.open-agent-glossary/config.json`
- `.agents/open-agent-glossary/config.json`
- `.pi/open-agent-glossary/config.json`

### Global user-level (fallback)

- `~/.open-agent-glossary/config.json`
- `~/.agents/open-agent-glossary/config.json`
- `~/.config/open-agent-glossary/config.json`
- `~/.pi/agent/extensions/open-agent-glossary/config.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "sessionTtlMinutes": 30,
  "glossaryMode": "merge",
  "glossaryPin": "",
  "extraGlossaryPaths": [],
  "disableGlobalGlossary": false,
  "disableProjectGlossary": false,
  "ui": {
    "autostart": false,
    "port": 7337,
    "open": true
  }
}
```
